# Customer Segmentation

## Problem Statement

The Customer Segmentation project focuses on the segmentation of customers based on their purchase history and behavioral patterns. By harnessing the power of machine learning, particularly k-means clustering, this project aims to provide valuable insights for businesses in understanding and catering to their customer segments.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized an extensive e-commerce transaction dataset that includes detailed customer purchase history. This dataset forms the core of the customer segmentation analysis, allowing us to uncover meaningful patterns and segments.

## AWS Integration

The Customer Segmentation project seamlessly integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage advanced tools and capabilities:

- **Amazon SageMaker K-means Clustering**: I implemented k-means clustering using AWS SageMaker. This technique helps in grouping similar customers together, providing businesses with a clearer picture of their customer base.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: The project efficiently stores cluster labels and customer segment data in Amazon DynamoDB. This cloud-based database solution facilitates real-time user personalization, enabling businesses to offer tailored experiences.

## Deployment on AWS

The project's culmination is the implementation of personalized product recommendations on a website using AWS Lambda. By utilizing the customer segments identified through clustering, the website offers product recommendations that resonate with each segment's preferences, enhancing user engagement and conversion rates.
